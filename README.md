a safe place to grow a brave place to grow genkiness

to help a diabetic dyslexic second grader in a Salem, OR public school we assigned YELLOW as our starting place. I yell OW! seemed appropriate for a 2nd grader coming to grips with his new life-style and he was taught that even though he can't cry every time we check his blood sugar, he had a mother who would cry with him whenever he needed it.

The Color Wheel creates a squence that seemed to circumvent his dyslexia and we agreed to orient our wheel such that yellow was followed by red followed by blue.

When we added secondary issues like occupation, education, and environment we found Y > O > R > P > B > G > Y created a full daily cycle that could be kept ad infinitum.

Days eventually turn into weeks and those turn into months and years and eventually even decades and millenia so our 6 became 9 which became 12 and then 15. 

15. Every new diabetic knows that number and quickly comes to know it's multiples of 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90.

90 degrees is a perpendicular turn. It's a life decision. It's deviating from massugu (straight) and making a change of direction or velocity. 90 degrees clockwise is a Right Turn and it takes 180 degrees to turn around and 270 degrees for that Right turn to become a Left turn.

90 + 10 = 100% = 〇 = one whole

My children saw me conspicuously donate money to several causes over the years and wikipedia was one of them. This software supplements those efforts and hopefully yields a system that will provide sustainable lifestyle projects consistent with the preaching of Nazarenes and the professing of academics with the prophecy that science and reason protect as providence.

The goal is to reduce the need for crisis management because people are generally more content with a purpose and we want a world where that purpose is rooted in kindness and peace.

This project can be summarized like this: [{(〇)}]

So, my 2030 千羽鶴 senbazuru breaks down like this in my mind: (千){羽}[鶴]

[鶴] crane [goal/destination]
{羽} feathers {ingredients/verb/style}
(千) iterations (1000/∞)
